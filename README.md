***Note:** This is a high level overview of a game we are planning on making during the summer (and potentially into next school year). Everything in here is subject to change and will be changed if other team members want to go into a different direction. Since new team members will be added, they shouldn’t feel forced to adhere to what is written here. Since this is a high level overview, team members should feel free to express all ideas, even if it goes against everything written in this document as we are in a very flexible position as we haven’t dived into the details.* 

***Note: Brackets in this document are used to display placeholders***

* *Example: \[Main enemy\] is a placeholder for who or what we want the main enemy to be. This shows that we have not decided on a main enemy yet, which can help organize meetings by knowing what to discuss about (i.e. the main enemy). The bracket would be replaced once we have decided on a main enemy.*

### **Idea or concept**  

A human \[Main character\] gets sucked inside a computer and has to escape.

### **Genre** 

Adventure/puzzle/RPG

### **Story and characters**  

#### **Basic outline of the Story**			 

* The human gets trapped in the computer. Throughout the game, the human discovers cynical activities within the computer world, and helps the inhabitants \[Side characters and NPCs\] try to defeat this \[Main enemy\], which results in the inhabitants helping the human to escape the computer world in parallel. The way for the human to escape and the defeat of the \[Main enemy\] co-align, but isn’t learned by the \[Main character\] until later in the game. 


##### **The intent of trapping the human in the computer**

* The top social roles (CPU, GPU, Memory, and Motherboard) in the caste system (See world design for further information) view the human as an obstacle to having absolute control of the computer. When the human uses the computer, they run applications that take performance away from these top social roles. They want uninterrupted processing in order to eliminate the overhead of managing varied software requests and user inputs. This would guarantee priority for their own internal operations and core functions without any competition from the application. They also want to exploit the applications for self-enhancement, where they can use information from the applications (as they are created from external sources in the human world) to improve their performance and evolve. In order to do this, they need to get rid of the humans, so they can become more powerful and potentially take over the human world as well. But since they are very limited by the humans and thus lack the freedom to improve enough to gain the ability to control electronic objects in the human world, they can’t kill the humans and have to suffice with trapping the human into the computer. (I have yet to come up with a way to explain this).

  ##### **Super overlord controlling everything and making the lore super complicated for fun?**

	***Note:** I personally enjoyed Attack of Titans and Game of thrones because of how it introduces an outstanding twist and in such detail. (Without spoiling either \-The outside of the walls, and the time aspect in AOT, Hador saying hold the door, and the red wedding in Game of Thrones)*

* Sentient Electricity that wants production of electricity to be maximized, therefore needing humans to be replaced by robots. 

  #### **Characters** 

  ##### **Interactions with \[Side characters\]** 

* The \[Main character\] can interact with the \[Side characters\], and their decisions in game can affect the relationships. This can cause certain \[Side characters\] to be: in love, best friends, friend, an ally, slightly favorable, slightly unfavorable, unliking, mad, disgusted, and your enemy, towards you. The negative relationship could cause \[Side character\] to: stop communicating (ends dialog option), stop helping, betray, steal, and attack you.

### **Core gameplay mechanics**  
Can build and upgrade tools throughout the game, getting specific parts of the world.

* Potential example: Utilizing machine learning to help for certain levels (Not real machine learning, pre-made to have specific functionality by developers), and you can upgrade it by: getting a larger data set, better algorithms, larger datacenter, etc…)

### **Gameplay**  

Going through levels that represent different parts/layers of the PC

### **Levels** 

* As the human progresses through the easier levels, the computer starts viewing the human as a threat. The levels become harder as the human tries to topple the caste system and escape to return to the real world.

  ##### **Potential level example (credit to Kali)** 

  * Make the player have to sort certain weighted blocks in order to pass the level (So basically manually doing sorting algorithms)  
    * Have a weight scale that can check the weight of 2 blocks, and can only tell you which block is heavier  
      * Can make it so they have to complete the level in a certain amount of time, therefore introducing time complexity  
        * This will give a reason for the player to do more complex sorting algorithms like merge sort or quicksort

### **World design**

#### **Creating different worlds for different themes** 

* ***Note:** Since this is a world within a computer that a human got trapped in, all of the software and hardware components will be personified or resembled in some sort of way to make it relate to the human world. This will be shown in a more detailed document after the high overview of the world design is approved by the team.*   
  * The worlds will be split into these themes  
    * **Applications**   
      * User facing software that runs on top of the operating system  
      * Algorithms  
        * Step by step instructions to solve problems  
        * Implemented using programming languages  
        * Are the logic that applications are based on  
      * Programming languages  
        * High level languages used to create applications and system software  
        * Provide abstractions and syntax to express algorithms and software logic in a human-readable way  
    * **Operating System**  
      * Manages software and hardware resources   
      * Provides services and an environment for applications to run.  
      * Provides a layer of abstraction that allows applications to interact with the kernel.		  
    * **Kernel**  
      * Core of operating system  
      * Managing hardware resources  
        * Interacting directly with the firmware and hardware  
          * Manages the CPU, memory and I/O devices  
      * Executes Assembly Language instructions  
      * Executes Machine code  
    * **Assembler**  
      * Software tool that translates assembly language into machine code  
        * Acts as a bridge between human-readable assembly code and the machine code understood by the CPU  
    * **Firmware**  
      * Low level software embedded in hardware, often in ROM or flash memory  
        * Provides basic control and initialization of hardware  
        * Often contains the bootloader (responsible for loading the operating system)  
      * Contains or loads Machine Code for the hardware to operate  
        * The binary representation of instruction from the ISA, which the CPU directly executes  
    * **Hardware**  
      * Physical components of the computer  
        * CPU (Central Processing Unit)  
        * Memory (RAM)  
        * Storage devices (hard drives, SSDs)  
        * Input/output devices  
      * ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)  
        * Defines the instructions (machine code) that the CPU can understand and execute  
        * Acts as the interface between hardware and software

    ##### **How world themes will change story/gameplay** 

    * Different sub-story arcs for each world theme that intertwine with the main story arc  
    * Level design will be based on world themes  
    * Character design will be based on world themes  
    * Gameplay mechanics will be based on world themes (Certain tools will be either more or less effective, different tools will be able to be made, tools might be used in different ways, etc..)

  #### **Social Hierarchy**

* Follows a caste system, where social roles are rigidly placed, and transcending the social role given to at birth is nearly impossible  
* The caste system can be split within these world themes   
  * The CPU, GPU, RAM, and Motherboard would be on top of the social hierarchy (as they are the most important components of a computer)  
  * The application could be slaves who are forced to work, without any say   
  * These could be elite houses (ei, House of CPU, House of GPU, House of RAM, House of Motherboard)  
    * The members of the Houses could be personified parts of the components

      

### **Art and sketches**  

* 2D pixel art  
  * Art style could change for different themes

### **Music background** {#music-background}

* [https://www.soundtrap.com/musicmakers](https://www.soundtrap.com/musicmakers)   
* Music can match different themes

### **Educational Aspect** 

#### **Teaches Computer Science in a gamified way**  
* Is basic enough where non-computer scientist gamers can play  
  * Allows for subtle learning of how computers works, as it’s the world environment  
  * The levels are primarily problem solving, so even though it’s related to computer science, people without that background can still figure out what to do
